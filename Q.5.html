        <dt>1.What is tech stack?</dt>
        <dd>A tech stack is short for technology stack. It’s a list of all the technology services used to build and run a single application or website. 

            We call it a stack because you can visualize the technologies being stacked on top of each other, from frontend to backend, to build an application.
            
            A tech stack may also be called a solutions stack, technology infrastructure, or the data ecosystem. 
            
            The exact combination of technologies will vary depending on the product, the scale of the company and the decisions and preferences of the system’s architects. That said, the elements are often similar.</dd>
            <dt>2.What is a web stack?</dt>
            <dd>A web stack is the same but for web development specifically. This is everything needed to implement your website, software as a service product, etc.

                The top element is the application the user interacts with. The bottom element is the operating system running the application. Then you have all the stuff in between, which acts like interpreters between the two, helping them understand what the other wants.</dd>
                <dt>3.Wrap up</dt>
    <dd>Now you have an idea what a tech stack is, as well as the major stacks out there for web development and their salaries. 
        
        When deciding which tech stack to learn, keep in mind there’s no one right answer. The one that you choose to learn can determine which companies you’d like to work in, but in the end it’s most important that you start.</dd>
